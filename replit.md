# Somvi - Project Documentation

## Overview
This project was imported from GitHub (https://github.com/rashka1/Somvi) on November 02, 2025.

## Current State
The repository is essentially empty, containing only:
- README.md with the title "Somvi"
- .replit configuration file

## Import Status
The GitHub repository does not contain any application code, configuration files, or dependencies. It appears to be a newly created repository without any implementation yet.

## Next Steps
To make this a functional project, you would need to:
1. Define what type of application Somvi should be
2. Set up the appropriate tech stack
3. Add application code and dependencies
4. Configure build and run scripts
